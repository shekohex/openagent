# Feature Specification: OpenAgent MVP Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-initial-mvp-implementation`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Ready for Planning  
**Input**: User description: "Initial MVP implementation based on PLAN.md - Web UI, Orchestrator (Convex), and Sidecar architecture"
**Project Vision**: Cloud-based AI coding agents (OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, etc.) accessible via web interface for cross-device development sessions

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Initial MVP implementation for background coding agent
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: users, orchestrator, sidecar services, coding agents
   ‚Üí Actions: auth, session management, code execution, streaming
   ‚Üí Data: sessions, provider keys, messages, permissions
   ‚Üí Constraints: sandboxed containers, secure key handling
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with clarification needs
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary user flow established for session lifecycle
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and user-focused
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Users, Sessions, Provider Keys, Messages
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to access cloud-based AI coding agents through a web interface where I can type project requirements, watch the agent work in real-time, and continue sessions across different devices, so that I can delegate development tasks to AI without managing local environments or exposing API keys.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user without configured API keys, **When** they attempt to start a session, **Then** they are guided through key setup (BYOK or managed)
2. **Given** a user with configured keys, **When** they start a new session, **Then** a secure coding environment is provisioned and ready within 30 seconds
3. **Given** an active coding session, **When** the user sends a coding request, **Then** they see real-time streaming output of the agent's actions
4. **Given** the agent requests a permission (e.g., file deletion), **When** the user responds, **Then** the action proceeds or halts based on the response
5. **Given** a completed session, **When** the user wants their code, **Then** they can export it as a ZIP file or push to GitHub
6. **Given** an interrupted session, **When** the user returns, **Then** they can resume from where they left off

### Edge Cases
- What happens when provider API keys are invalid or expired?
- How does system handle session timeout after prolonged inactivity?
- What occurs when the container runs out of resources?
- How are concurrent permission requests handled?
- What happens if export fails mid-process?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create authenticated accounts
- **FR-002**: System MUST support both bring-your-own-keys (BYOK) and managed key options for AI providers (dynamically fetched from models.dev)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to start, stop, and resume coding sessions
- **FR-004**: System MUST stream all agent actions and outputs in real-time to the user
- **FR-005**: System MUST request user permission for sensitive operations (file deletions, external API calls, etc.)
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to export their code via ZIP download or GitHub push
- **FR-007**: System MUST isolate each session in a secure container with no access to other sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST encrypt and securely store provider API keys
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to switch AI models/providers during a session
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a terminal interface for direct command execution
- **FR-011**: System MUST track and display token usage and context window information
- **FR-012**: System MUST support slash commands for specialized agent operations
- **FR-013**: System MUST persist session state indefinitely for MVP (post-MVP: tiered retention based on subscription)
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle session idle timeout after 15 minutes (configurable)
- **FR-015**: Users MUST be able to view and manage multiple sessions
- **FR-016**: System MUST display real-time agent activities (file edits, commands, thinking process) in the UI
- **FR-017**: System MUST enable cross-device session continuity through cloud storage
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide a chat interface for users to input project requirements

### Key Entities
- **User**: Authenticated individual with email, creation timestamp, subscription tier (MVP: free/self-hosted, Post-MVP: paid tiers)
- **Session**: Cloud-based coding workspace with unique ID, title, status, persistent across devices
- **Provider Key**: Encrypted API credentials for AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. from models.dev)
- **Message**: Chat interface communication between user and agent with real-time streaming
- **Permission Request**: Pending approval for sensitive operations with request details and user response
- **Session Artifact**: Exported code or backup with type (ZIP/GitHub) and cloud storage location
- **Agent Activity**: Real-time display of file edits, commands, and thinking process
